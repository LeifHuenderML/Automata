## Individual Contributions

### Leif Huender

#### Tasks Completed

- Wrote the RL engine training cycle
- Began converting my pytorch code to C++
- Change my output to fit the input for the game engine from Aaron


#### Plans for Next Week

- Finish converting from pytorch to C++. The reason I wrote it initially in pytorch is becaue python with ml libraries is my strongest programming language so it is easier to convert it than it is to bear the onloading process of new syntax for the same methods.
- Train the RL model on the main game logic.

### Aaron Froese

#### Tasks Completed

- Refactored code for the RL Engine to be more modular.
- Testing the newly refactored code to see how well it works with new changes.


#### Plans for Next Week

- Reduce runtime ineficciencies to make the program able to run on less compute.

### Shaun Swant

#### Tasks Completed

- Began working on the UI for the game
- Created all the menu pages and buttons using SFML

#### Plans for Next Week

- Continue working on the UI
- Continue testing the UI
